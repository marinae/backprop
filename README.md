# datamining2

Homeworks for the second part of datamining course in Technosphere (year 2015).

Some homeworks are focused on re-implementing scikit-learn algorithms while obtaining the same quality.  
1. Stochastic gradient boosting (with sampling and learning rate)  
2. Feature selection (embedded and filter methods)  
3. Active learning  
4. Backpropagation algorithm for neural network (tested on noised pictures with English letters)
